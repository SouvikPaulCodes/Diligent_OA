Create a Node.js script named generateData.js that generates 5 synthetic e-commerce CSV files:

1. users.csv -> id, name, email, created_at
2. products.csv -> id, name, category, price
3. orders.csv -> id, user_id, order_date, total_amount
4. order_items.csv -> id, order_id, product_id, quantity, item_price
5. payments.csv -> id, order_id, payment_method, payment_status, payment_date

Requirements:
- Generate realistic, relational synthetic data
- user_ids referenced in orders must exist in users
- product_ids referenced in order_items must exist in products
- orders referenced in payments must exist
- Ensure price * quantity sums match order total_amount
- Save all CSV files inside a folder named `data`
- Use faker.js (or @faker-js/faker) for fake names and dates
